                Welcome to this joyous celebration of baptism! Today we gather to witness the public declaration of faith and the symbolic washing away of sin as our brothers and sisters in Christ are baptized. We rejoice with them as they take this important step of obedience and identification with Jesus Christ.

            <h2>The Meaning of Baptism</h2>
            <p>
                Baptism is an outward expression of an inward faith. It symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and our identification with Him. When we are immersed in the water, it represents being buried with Christ. When we are raised from the water, it symbolizes our resurrection to new life in Him.
            </p>
            <h3>What Baptism Represents:</h3>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Cleansing:</strong> We are washed clean from our sins through faith in Jesus</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>New Life:</strong> We rise to walk in newness of life, empowered by the Holy Spirit</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Public Declaration:</strong> We publicly identify ourselves as followers of Jesus Christ</li>
